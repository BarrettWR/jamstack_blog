# Jamstack Blog Project

 The architecture of this site is built on the Jamstack Architecture, a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

The backend of this site is powered by Express and Node. Express, being a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

For the frontend, I utilized Vue 3 and TailwindCSS. Vue 3 is the latest version of Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was used for styling the site.

One of the key features of this blog site is the user login system. I implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication and session functionality.

Users of the site have the ability to submit comments under posts. As the admin of the site, I have the privilege to submit posts via a protected route.
